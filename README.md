## Project Description:
- We analyze text and classify it into non-hateful or hateful speech.
- Therefore we would have 2 categories / labels: non-hateful = 0, hateful = 1
- We use the data presented here in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waalbannyantudre/hate-speech-detection-curated-dataset
- Our project would focus on LSTM and BERT
